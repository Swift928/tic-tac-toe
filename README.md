# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is part of The Odin Project (TOP) curriculum, showcasing my skills in web development.

## Overview

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic game that I implemented using modern web development techniques. The goal was to reinforce and demonstrate my understanding of fundamental concepts like classes, factory functions, IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression), and responsive web design.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The Tic-Tac-Toe game is designed to work seamlessly across various devices, ensuring an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile platforms.

- **Computer Player**: In addition to the standard two-player mode, the game includes a computer player. While not unbeatable, the computer player provides a challenging single-player experience.

- **Object-Oriented Approach**: I utilized classes and factory functions to organize and structure the code, making it more modular and maintainable.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: The core technologies used for building the web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## How to Play

- Visit the [live demo](https://swift928.github.io/tic-tac-toe/) to experience the Tic-Tac-Toe game.

- For a two-player game, take turns with a friend to mark Xs and Os on the board. The first player to align three of their symbols in a row wins.

- Player One will be X, while Player 2 will be O.

## Future Enhancements

While the current version provides a solid implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe, future enhancements could include:

- **Improved AI**: Enhance the computer player to make more intelligent moves, providing a tougher challenge for players.

Feel free to contribute, report issues, or suggest improvements!
